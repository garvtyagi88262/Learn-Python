            "Merry Christmas, Sally try not to kill anyone. With these words my consultant to breezily hung up the phone leaving me to handle an entire world of patients alone. I was in Utica lafai to Junior doctor and three weeks previously had made a rookie error forget to fill out a form to request the holidays off now here I was managing a hospital Ward on my own on Christmas Day things that started badly and I was confronted by the first emergency. A man is 53 collapsed from a severe cardiac arrest and then he needed a manual evacuation if you know, you know at 10:30 a.m. I looked around the world Miss Janice was sprinting up-and-down career away in a panic on Corridor be a stubborn elderly patient was loudly demanding his misplaced anxious. Coral Sea have been taken over by a drunken Exile from the emergency department housing olive olive. I haven't gone to all that was every minute. Somebody was making a new tomorrow early. Can you check on this is a fever. Can you help with miss a thing with elevated potassium found myself starting to panic Medical School hadn't prepared me for anything like that until then. I've always been quite an effective student whenever the going got tough must try to do a simple work harder. It was a message that it got me into Medical School 70s previously. It had allowed me to secure a handful of Publications in academic journals. It even allowed me to launch a business while I studied discipline with the only productivity system on you and it worked. Except now it wasn't working. Installing at the doctor a few months previously. I felt like I was drowning even when Listen to the night. I couldn't see the number of patients will finish the paperwork that I needed to my mood was suffering too. I enjoyed my medical training to be a doctor, but I was finding the actual job at Ali depressing constantly worrying that I might make a mistake that would kill someone. I stopped sleeping friendship faded my family still caring for me and I just kept working harder and now this Christmas day alone on a Hostess reward failing to get through my shift. Everything came to a head one a drop the tray of medical supplies. I'd like the Lord looks down on my damn scrubs. I realized I had to figure things out on my dream of becoming a surgeon would slip through my fingers that night. So I hung up my stethoscope grabbed a mince pie and open my laptop at once been so productive. I thought what have I forgotten during my first year of medical school and become obsessed with a secret activity. I stayed up. Delta nights making notes on hundreds of Articles blog post in videos promising the key to Optimal Performance. Do the guru's emphasized the importance of hotslogs a Muhammad Ali quote came up a lot. I hated every minute of training but I said don't quit suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion as Christmas turn to boxing day. I stayed up pouring over my old notes and wondered whether that was where I was going wrong. I just need to regain my old work ethic but when I return to work the next day resolving to just do more it made no difference, even though I stayed on the board until midnight and even though I was reciting Muhammad Ali's line to myself you're in the toilet breaks. I wasn't getting through my paperwork and he's quicker at the end of my hottest day yet. I felt completely underwater and then for no way I remember some words of wisdom from a old cheese and don't talk like if the treatment isn't working. The diagnosis slowly and then all at once I started to doubt all the productivity of I sign it sold its success really require suffering. Did I have to trade my health and happiness. Well anything it would take me a few months. I was stumbling my way to Revelation but everything I've been told about success was wrong. I couldn't hustle my way to becoming a good doctor working out. It wasn't going to bring me happiness. And there was another popsicle filament one that wasn't lined with constant anxiety sleep is nice and it's concerning dependence on caffeine. I didn't have all the answers. But for the first time I can make out the beginnings of an alternative approach an approach to focus on my well-being first and use that wall being to drive my focus and motivation s an approach. I would come to refer to as feel-good productivity. the surprising secrets of feel-good productivity My obsession with productivity and let me to tack on an extra year and a psychology degree as I started putting together the pieces of field of productivity. I remember to study I've been tested on one that involved a candle a book of matches and a box of thumbtacks picture yourself with these three objects before you ask is to stick the candle the cork board on the wall so that when it's lit the candle wax word Recon to the table below if I use of puzzling over the items turning them over in your hands. Can you think of a solution? So when presented with this problem most people only consider the candle the matches at the thumbtacks but more Innovative Minds recognized the potential of the thumb tack box the ultimate solution to the puzzle involves reviewing the Thumbtack but not just as a container, but as a candle holder, this is the kind of problem. I classic test of creative thinking first developed by call. Ankara and published posthumously in 1945 and has since been used in countless studies testing everything from cognitive flexibility to the psychological Fallout of stress in the late 1970s psychologist, Alice. I used it as the basis for an influential experiment to study how mood affects people's creativity eyes and began by dividing of volunteers into two groups one group was given a small gift a bag of candy before facing the kind of problem the other group started the talk with no such incentive the theory went that those who were given the sweets would have a more positive mood when they try to solve the puzzle. I think I found something interesting those whose moods. The improved by the gift was significantly more successful in solving the candle problem. When I first read about ice and experiment during my psychology degree. I found it interesting but not exactly transformative. I've never felt overwhelming urge to stick a candle to a wall. But coming back to it as a junior doctor. I realize that I since inside was quite profound and suggested the feeling good doesn't just end with feeling good. It actually changes the patterns of thought and behavior. I know the times for the study had become the Cornerstone of a wave of research exploring the weight positive emotions affect many of a cognitive processes. It showed that when we're in a positive mood we tend to consider a broader range of actions be more open to new experiences and better integrate the information we receive another was feeling good through style creativity and productivity one of the first people to explore how exactly does wax was Barbara Fredrickson a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Frederickson is one of the leading figures in positive psychology a relatively new branch of psychology that focuses of understanding and promoting happiness in the late 1990s Frederickson proposed what she called. Broaden and build theory of positive emotions, according to the theory positive emotions broaden our awareness and build a cognitive and social resources broaden refers to the immediate effect of positive emotions. When was feeling good a Minds open up we take in more information and we seen will possibilities around us consider the candle problem in a positive mood participants were able to see a broader range of potential Solutions build refers to the long-term effects of positive emotions. When we experience positive emotions, we build up a reservoir of mental and emotional resources that can help us in the future resources, like resilience creativity problem-solving skills, social connections and physical health of the time these two processes reinforce each other creating an upward spiral of positivity growth and success the series That's the whole new way of understanding the role of positive emotions in a life and not just freezing feelings that come and go without Consequence the integral to a cognitive functioning of social relationships and our overall well-being positive emotions of the fuel that drives the engine of human flourishing why I feel good productivity works when I first started learning about broadening build. I caught a glimpse of a different way of thinking about my life. But yes, I thought that by simply hustling harder I could achieve the things I wanted if I wanted to be a good doctor the life ahead of me would be defined by grinding unrelenting work. Now, I could see another way frederickson's Theory suggests the post of emotions change the way of brains upright Step One is feeling better step two is doing more warm us to us, but why I wanted the more I read it the more I realize that the explanations of varied. Some cases remain unclear but scientists have started to home in on a few Oz first feeling good Boost energy. Most of us have felt an energy that's not strictly physical or biological one. That doesn't come from Chicago, How do I get from a mix of motivation focus and inspiration. It's the energy you feel when you working on a particularly engrossing task when you're surrounded by inspiring people. This energy has many different names. It's been labeled as emotional spiritual mental or motivational energy by psychologists zest Vitality or energetic arousal by neuroscientist. But if research is Connor Green, what's the name it there a great that it makes us focused inspired and motivated to the seawall goals. So what's the source of this mysterious energy the short answer feeling good positive emotions are bound up with a set of four humans and dolphins. Serotonin dopamine and oxytocin are often labeled as a feel-good hormones all of them allow us to accomplish more and dolphins are often released during physical activity stress or pain and bring about feelings of happiness and diminished discomfort and elevated levels. Usually correlate with increased energy and motivation serotonin is connected to mood regulation sleep appetite and overall feelings of well-being it on the pens our sense of contentment and gives us the energy to Taco task sufficiently reward is linked with motivation and pleasure and its release provides a satisfaction that allows us to focus longer oxytocin known as the love hormone is associated with social bonding trust and relationship-building which enhances our capacity to connect with others and in turn impact of productivity. This means that these feel-good hormones are Starting point of a virtuous cycle when we feel good. We generate energy which boost the productivity and this productivity leads to feelings which even which make us feel good all over again s feeling good reduces of stress in addition to the broaden and build Theory Barbara Frederick's and also developed a psychologist Cola the undoing hypothesis frederiksen and colleagues were interested in decades of research showing the negative for the release of stress hormones, like adrenaline and cortisol. This isn't a problem in the short time that the mechanism that motivates us to run from danger. But if we experienced these negative Sensations, too often, we become riddled with anxiety kind of physical health suffers The Continuous activation of these woman's can even increase the risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure not ideal Frederickson wondered about the flip side if negative emotions have been some political effects. Pacific Oceans cover busting my feeling-good reset the nervous system in for the body into a more relaxed state to test this out Frederickson came up with a rata mean study research has told a group of people that they had one minute to prepare a public speech that would be filmed and judge by that pierce knowing that the fear of public speaking is practically Universal Frederickson hypothesize that this would Elevate the subject levels of anxiety and stress and people reported feeling more anxious and experienced increases in heart rate and blood pressure next to the researchers randomly assigned participants to watch one of four films to evoking multi positive emotions aside beautiful ones and the full sad ones and they've been measured how long it took the participants to recover from the stress. The findings were intriguing the participants who watched the positive emotion films to significantly less time to return. Baseline state in terms of heart rate and blood pressure and those who watched the sadness evoking filming took the longest time to return to Baseline. This is the undoing hypothesis that post of emotions can undo the effects of stress and other negative emotion. It stresses the problem than feeling good might just be the solution but the final and perhaps most transformative implication of field of productivity goes well beyond any want a school project feeling good in riches your life in 2005 a team of psychologists read all the stories. They can find on the complex relationship between happiness and success. They delve into 225 published papers, which involve data from over two hundred and seventy-five thousand individuals that question does success as we're often told make us happier, or could it be the other way around the study of it. Evidence that we tend to get happiness wrong individuals who frequently experience positive emotions on just more sociable optimistic and creative. They also accomplished more these people bring an infectious energy to their environment proving more likely to enjoy fulfilling relationships get higher salaries and fruity shine in their professional lives.
